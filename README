Library Management System

A modular C++ backend with a modern web-based frontend.

Overview

The Library Management System (LMS) is a complete digital platform that manages:

Books

Laptops

Study rooms

Users

Borrowing & returning operations

Activity history

Admin overview

The backend is implemented entirely in C++, and exposes a structured REST API.
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a clean and intuitive interface.

Architecture

The system follows a two-tier architecture consisting of:

Frontend (Client Layer)

The user interface is built using:

HTML for structure

CSS for styling and layout

JavaScript for interaction and dynamic rendering

The frontend is responsible for:

Displaying books, laptops, rooms, and user activity

Handling user interactions

Collecting inputs (search queries, borrow actions, reservations, login details)

Communicating with the backend through REST API calls

All logic in the browser is handled in script.js, which interacts with the backend using the fetch() API.

Backend (Application Layer)

The backend is implemented entirely in C++, with a modular design that includes components such as:

Book management

Laptop management

Member operations

Borrowing/returning logic

Room scheduling

Authentication

Inventory and admin views

These components expose their functionality through a dedicated REST API server (server.cpp).
The frontend does not access the internal C++ logic directly — instead, it communicates with HTTP endpoints that return structured JSON responses.

Communication Between Frontend and Backend

The two layers communicate using:

HTTP requests (GET, POST)

JSON payloads for sending and receiving data

For example:

When the user searches for a book, the frontend sends a GET request to /api/search.

When borrowing a book, the frontend sends a POST request to /api/borrow/{id}.

When reserving a study room, it sends a JSON payload to /api/rooms/book.

The backend processes the request, interacts with the internal C++ models, and returns the appropriate JSON response, which the frontend uses to update the UI.

Frontend

Located in /LibraryFrontend

Contains all UI components:

index.html

style.css

script.js

Communicates with backend over REST (fetch() calls)

Backend

Entirely C++

Implements all library logic:

Book management

Laptop management

Room reservations

Authentication

Borrow/return operations

Exposes endpoints through a REST server (server.cpp)

REST Layer

All backend functionality is accessible through:

/api/books
/api/laptops
/api/rooms
/api/activity
/api/login
/api/signup
...

Frontend Features

Dashboard-style interface

Search functionality

Book browsing

Laptop management

Dynamic room slot display

Activity timeline

Wishlist

Light/dark theme toggle

Authentication modal

Admin data panels

All interactions occur through API calls defined in script.js.

Backend Features

Modular C++ class design

Encapsulated logic for:

Books, Laptops, Members

Borrowing

Preferences

Study rooms

Inventory operations

JSON-based communication

Stateless HTTP API

Clean separation of logic and server layer

Build System

The backend uses:

CMake
C++17
Pistache (HTTP)
nlohmann/json


All backend components are compiled into a single server executable.

The frontend requires no build step.

Design Principles

Separation of concerns

Reusable C++ classes

Clean REST abstractions

Fully client-side rendered UI

JSON-based communication

Expandable architecture (e.g., database support in the future)
